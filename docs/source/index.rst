Welcome to sarracenia's documentation!
======================================

Caveat: 
   This new web-site is for version 3 currently under development in the v03_wip branch
   Users of stable version 2 should go https://github.com/MetPX/Sarracenia instead.
   While the code for version 3 is stabilizing nicely, the docs are not completely ready.
